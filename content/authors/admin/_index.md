Rohit Duggal is a PhD student in Geothermal Energy Engineering at Victoria University of Wellington. My research interests are inclined with low-temperature geothermal energy generation in oil and gas fields. This resource could replace fossil fuel usage, and reduce emissions. Geothermal utilization would also bring a new life to the infrastructure, industry, and extend the economic life of this resource. 

In my research, I would be addressing the question of how can we best utilize this resource? How sustainable are these resources as a source of energy? and How to utilize it for direct use application in an economically and environmentally viable way? I intend to answer these questions through intensive reservoir modelling, wellbore analysis, and surface-level engineering studies.
